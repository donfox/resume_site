 <p>
  I'm a software developer with experience across diverse domains, including telecommunications, 
  data-intensive systems, code analysis and refactoring, technical documentation, and electronic 
  medical records. Alongside applied work, I've participated in R&D effortsâ€”often with internsâ€”
  spanning data science, Bitcoin, and related areas. Most of my work has been on Unix systems 
  using the GNU toolchain. Increasingly, however, Iâ€™m drawn to projects with a more exploratory 
  or academic character, particularly those that benefit from the functional paradigm and, more 
  recently, the emerging field of prompt engineering as a way to shape interactions with machine 
  learning systems.
</p>
  <p>
    This site serves as a space to share my resume, selected GitHub repositories, and reflections on books and articles.
    The projects highlighted here reflect both practical and exploratory pursuits: from applied tools like Bitcoin 
    indexing, to more conceptual investigations in Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure. Some of this work began as exercises with
    interns, and I continue to refine and re-implement these efforts with the aim of producing clearer, more rigorous 
    contributions. Looking ahead, I see opportunities to develop projects at the intersection of functional programming,
    formal methods, and the study of how prompt 
    engineering can serve as a bridge between computation and language.

<section class="construction">
  <p>As this site develops, I may add a few elements that extend beyond a resume and project list.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programming Reflections:</strong> Occasional writings on programming and related 
    topicsâ€”ranging from functional paradigms to prompt engineering, or simply observations drawn from 
    projects and reading. These are intended less as tutorials than as a way to clarify ideas and 
    trace connections across areas of interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> A straightforward means for colleagues and collaborators 
    to reach out. For now, email or familiar tools like Telegram remain the preferred options.</li>
  </ul>
