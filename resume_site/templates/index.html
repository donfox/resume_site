    <p>
      I'm an experienced software engineer with a diverse background in telecommunications, technical
      consulting and collaboration, electronic medical records, data analysis, document archiving,
      and code analysis and refactoring. I've also worked with interns on R&D projects in data
      science and Bitcoin. Most of my work has been on Unix systems using the GNU toolchain and
      relational databases. I'm currently open to remote, contract, or freelance opportunities.
      Feel free to explore the site, request my resume, or reach out regarding possible collaborations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site serves as a space to share my resume, selected GitHub repositories, and reflections
      on books and articles. The projects and related materials reflect my interestsâ€”ranging from
      practical applications like Bitcoin indexing to more abstract investigations in functional
      programming (Haskell, Lisp, Clojure). I'm revisiting earlier Bitcoin-related work, originally
      built as educational tools for interns and myself, with an eye toward refining, re-implementing
      in more suitable languages, and possibly evolving into standalone research pieces.

  <section class="construction">
    <p>As this site evolves, I may expand it, as time permits, with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Reflections and Notes:</strong> Musings and commentary on programming
      topics that happen to interest meâ€”likely aligned with the themes mentioned above.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Channels:</strong> I may include a simple way for colleagues or
      collaborators to get in touch. For now, email or familiar apps like Telegram are preferred.</li>
