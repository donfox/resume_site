    <p>
      I'm an experienced software engineer with a diverse background in telecommunications, technical 
      consulting and collaboration, electronic medical records, data analysis, document archiving, 
      and code analysis and refactoring. I've also worked with interns on R&D projects in data 
      science and Bitcoin. Most of my work has been on Unix systems using the GNU toolchain and 
      relational databases. I'm currently open to remote, contract, or freelance opportunities. 
      Feel free to explore the site, request my resume, or reach out regarding possible collaborations.
    </p>  
    <p>
      This site serves as a space to share my resume, selected GitHub repositories, and reflections 
      on books and articles. The projects and related materials reflect my interests—ranging from 
      practical applications like Bitcoin indexing to more abstract investigations in functional 
      programming (Haskell, Lisp, Clojure). I'm revisiting earlier Bitcoin-related work, originally 
      built as educational tools for interns and myself, with an eye toward refining, re-implementing 
      in more suitable languages, and possibly evolving into standalone research pieces.

  <section class="construction">
    <p>As this site evolves, I may expand it, as time permits, with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Reflections and Notes:</strong> Musings and commentary on programming 
      topics that happen to interest me—likely aligned with the themes mentioned above.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Communication Channels:</strong> I may include a simple way for colleagues or 
      collaborators to get in touch. For now, email or familiar apps like Telegram are preferred.</li>
    </ul>
