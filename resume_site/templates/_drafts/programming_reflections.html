  <h1>Programming Reflections</h1>
  <p>
    This page collects occasional notes on programming, functional paradigms, 
    and related areas such as prompt engineering. These are not tutorials, 
    but short reflections and working ideas — part of an ongoing effort to 
    clarify my own thinking and trace connections across projects and reading.

    <h2>Prompt Engineering and the Functional Mindset <span class="date">August 2025</span></h2>
    <p>
      Functional programming has long appealed to me for the clarity it brings: 
      small, composable functions, transparent data transformations, and a 
      declarative style that emphasizes “what” over “how.” Lately, I’ve been 
      struck by how similar instincts arise when working with large language 
      models through prompt engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good prompt, like a well-crafted function, isolates assumptions, 
      defines inputs clearly, and produces outputs that can be composed with 
      others. Both are fragile when overloaded with implicit context, yet 
      surprisingly robust when treated as small, testable building blocks. 
      This analogy is imperfect, of course, but it has helped me think about 
      prompts less as magic incantations and more as artifacts subject to 
      the same discipline I value in programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect to return to this parallel in future notes, exploring whether 
      functional abstractions might suggest better ways to design, test, or 
      even generate prompts systematically. For now, I leave it here as a 
      first reflection: a reminder that ideas from one domain often find 
      unexpected echoes in another.
