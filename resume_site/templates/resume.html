    <h4>Summary</h4>
     <p>
     I'm software engineer with a project history spaning many diverse domains, such as telecommunications, warehousing, medical claims and healthcare IT ...etc.  My focus has been mostly on backend development but with only occasional contributions to web development. Work has been almodt exclusively on Unix platforms using the GNU toolchain. 
   </p>

    <p>In addition to my technical work, I have had the opportunity to mentor interns and collaborate on complex 
      projects, emphasizing thoughtful problem-solving and reliable system design. I am currently open to remote or 
      freelance opportunities that align with my experience and interests.</p>
